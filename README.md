# wind-series-project
Made a detailed exploratory and statistical analysis on wind data in a 1 hour interval from 2003 to 2023 . Built a Autoregressive and ARIMA model and made statistical analysis between the generated wind data and the actual wind data. This was a part of my intern work at Wood PLC from January 2024 to February 2024
